Fairness

Discrimination


Group fairness: “It is a requirement that the protected groups should be treated similarly to the advantaged group or the population as a whole.” “Do the outcomes of a decision-making system systematically differ between social salient groups?”. 

 their outcomes can disproportionately hurt (or, benefit) particular groups of people sharing one or more sensitive attributes (e.g., race, sex).

we want the classifier to have the same behavior and performance among each of the protected classes.

In other words,  we believe the intention is to have a process which shows the same behavior and performance among each of the protected classes.

In other words, accepting a bias in the search criterion might be fair and justifiable if the evidence shows us that search findings are actually more likely in those classes we have bias against..

Regarding all the other features that have not been used.

we have already justified its exclusion as a first attempt to have a fair model
